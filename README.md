# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This is the back-end project creating a server for the WTWR application. Setting up the project implemented the use of Express. The database used is through Mongoose, & error testing was handled using Postman. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
